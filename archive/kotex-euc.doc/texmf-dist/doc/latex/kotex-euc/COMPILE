% kotexguide.tex includes kotexguidebody-utf.tex or -euc.tex.

The euc version of this document is prepared to test
the euc-compatible features of ko.TeX.
If you want to test it, make a file named 'definekg.eucmode'
in your working directory, whose contents are of no meaning.
When this file is detected, latex will include kotexguidebody-euc.tex
instead of -utf.tex. (If there are no -utf or -k files in your
directory, run generateeucfiles.sh first.)

$ touch definekg.eucmode

The final outputs are not identical,
because kotex/utf (a.k.a. hangul-ucs) uses different (improved)
way of linebreaking and fine spacing from kotex/euc (a.k.a. hlatex).

$ pdflatex kotexguide
$ pdflatex kotexguide (once more)
$ komkindex kotexguide
  ** index style option : (euc) -s hind, (utf) -s kotex
$ eucbmark.sh kotexguide (euc only)
  ** Windows : (call) eucbmark kotexguide
  ** eucbmark.sh calls euc-bookmark.pl
  ** this command should be processed just before final pdf generation.
  ** upon utf mode, this process is not required.
